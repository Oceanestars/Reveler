# Révéler

## About

Révéler is a simple and clear Chrome extension for people who are blind or visually impaired, instead of one designed for developers. 
This extension has a text to speech feature where when you click the run button it reads everything in the extension. There are categories which are aimed to make the raw data from the google accessibility audit api more easily understood. The filter setting is in progress so as of right now when you click each category the information that comes down is hardcoded. However, the grade given to a website is not. The grade depends on the number of error.
