# Révéler

## About

Révéler is a simple and clear Chrome extension for people who are blind or visually impaired, instead of one designed for developers. 
This extension has a text to speech feature where when you click the run button it reads everything in the extension. There are categories which are aimed to make the raw data from the google accessibility audit api more easily understood. The filter setting is in progress so as of right now when you click each category the information that comes down is hardcoded. However, the grade given to a website is not. The grade depends on the number of error.

## How to run this project

To run this project you have to clone it or download it
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Creative-Code-Project.git
```

Then you need to head to go [Google chrome extension](chrome://extensions/) and toggle on developer mode.
You then want to load this entire folder and it'll work!
If you plan on making any edits make sure to reload it everytime.
